This paper presents the development of mathematical models that characterize the inverter used in grid-connected photovoltaic systems. The mathematical models were fitted from experimental tests and they are suitable to be used in computer simulation software. The tests were performed on a set of inverters commercially available at Solar Energy Laboratory at Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS, Brazil) and at Photovoltaic Solar Energy Laboratory at Research Centre for Energy, Environment and Technology (CIEMAT, Spain). From the measured data it was calculated fitting coefficients to the efficiency curve of several inverters. In order to use these mathematical models for simulating other inverters, their own coefficients have to be experimentally determined and entered into the data base of the software in order to provide a full detailed computer simulation.},

@article{Cao2018,
abstract = {Wind Powered Thermal Energy Systems (WTES) are the entirety of all conceivable combinations that consist of wind energy converters and thermal energy storage facilities. Although there is still a pressing demand for innovative technological solutions that allow the decarbonization of power and especially heat supply, comparative costs assessments that include the direct conversion of wind energy into heat are pending. In this paper, we conduct such an analysis for the first time. In particular, a techno-economic analysis based on the calculation of levelized costs of heat supply (LCOE) is presented. The novelty of this study is the comparison of five specific WTES concepts which either make use of electric boilers, hydro-dynamic retarders or heat pumps. The spectrum of applications considered ranges from heat supply for individual buildings to small villages and cities. We design generic models of the WTES concepts under consideration, taking into account component dimensioning, cost structures and efficiency parameters. The results show that LCOE below 5 c€/kWh can be reached. This indicates already competitiveness compared to conventional space heating technologies. In this means, we provide a systematic framework for future studies to evaluate the particular economic potentials of WTES in the energy market.},

abstract = {A new domestic air-source heat pump model is proposed which can be parameterised either from field data, experimental data or manufacturers' standard rating data. The model differs from the much more prevalent system-side regression models for these types of heat pumps in that it operates on refrigerant-side variables. This makes it more suited to detailed performance analyses of heat pumps in service. Because both field data and manufacturers' data can be used for parameterising the model, it can be used to investigate problems associated with the building performance gap where a heat pump is used. A new type of efficiency-based compressor model is developed which enables compressor performance to be directly compared with alternatives and a model of defrosting is included by introducing a new defrost discounting term. Results tested using data from a field monitoring site and from a laboratory installation show good predictive behaviour by the model especially at low source air temperatures. When the model is fitted using manufacturer's standard rating data, a performance gap is evident when compared with the model fitted to field data but the gap is generally nominal.},

@article{Fowler2002,
abstract = {Currently there has been very little reliability or end-of-life analysis conducted for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEM) stacks, and detailed designs of PEM systems are still in a rapid evolutionary stage. Voltage degradation as a fuel cell ages is a widely observed phenomenon and results in a significant reduction in the electrical power produced by the stack. Little systematic information has been reported, however, and this phenomenon has not been included in electrochemical models. An earlier work described the development of the generalised steady state electrochemical model (GSSEM) which accepts as input the values of the operating variables (anode and cathode feed gas pressure and compositions, cell temperature and current density), and cell design parameters such as the active area and Nafion membrane thickness. This work will introduce new terms to the model to account for membrane electrode assembly (MEA) ageing, which is a factor in the durability of the stack. One term is based on the concept that the water-carrying capacity (a principal factor in membrane resistance) of the membrane deteriorates with time-in-service. A second term involves the apparent catalytic rate constants associated with the reactions on the anode and cathode side, and the changes in catalytic activity or active site density due to catalyst degradation. A third term deals with the decrease in the rate of mass transfer within the MEA. The resulting model is largely mechanistic, with most terms being derived from theory or including coefficients that have a theoretical basis, but includes empirical parameters to deal with the changing performance. Changes in the polarisation curve predicted by the generalised steady state electrochemical degradation model (GSSEDM) are demonstrated from the data for the performance of typical PEM fuel cell hardware. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

@article{Bezmalinovic2013,
abstract = {Expansion of telecommunication networks even to the most remote areas where connection to the utility grid could never be justified, especially in touristic regions, has led to the increasing need for stand-alone power systems. In Adriatic coastal area employment of hybrid photovoltaic-based systems is straightforward due to high sun potential. Inherent intermittent nature of renewable sources is especially not compatible with telecommunication system who require uninterrupted power supply. This leads to the need of not only energy storage, but also a "back up" solution in the case of primary system failure. Emphasis is put on the system reliability and simplicity while system price is not necessarily top priority. Usual approach of using diesel generators as a "back up" has been challenged by the introduction of PEM fuel cells. Even with hydrogen technologies market development still lagging behind some comparable advantages such as high energy conversion efficiency, silent operation and no emissions make PEM fuel cells a legitimate candidate for replacing traditional oil burning generators. Techno-economic analysis of various stand-alone power systems for the remote base station on an Adriatic island is made. At the moment, levelized cost of electricity point of view still gives slight advantage to the diesel generators. Though, uncertain petroleum market and fast developing hydrogen technology market could reverse this trend in the near future. Long term reliability of PEM fuel cells system still needs to be examined in practice, as this combined with pro-environmental characteristics of fuel cells can make the difference especially in pristine and protected areas. {\textcopyright} 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

@article{Hannan2017,
abstract = {Due to increasing concerns about global warming, greenhouse gas emissions, and the depletion of fossil fuels, the electric vehicles (EVs) receive massive popularity due to their performances and efficiencies in recent decades. EVs have already been widely accepted in the automotive industries considering the most promising replacements in reducing CO2 emissions and global environmental issues. Lithium-ion batteries have attained huge attention in EVs application due to their lucrative features such as lightweight, fast charging, high energy density, low self-discharge and long lifespan. This paper comprehensively reviews the lithium-ion battery state of charge (SOC) estimation and its management system towards the sustainable future EV applications. The significance of battery management system (BMS) employing lithium-ion batteries is presented, which can guarantee a reliable and safe operation and assess the battery SOC. The review identifies that the SOC is a crucial parameter as it signifies the remaining available energy in a battery that provides an idea about charging/discharging strategies and protect the battery from overcharging/over discharging. It is also observed that the SOC of the existing lithium-ion batteries have a good contribution to run the EVs safely and efficiently with their charging/discharging capabilities. However, they still have some challenges due to their complex electro-chemical reactions, performance degradation and lack of accuracy towards the enhancement of battery performance and life. The classification of the estimation methodologies to estimate SOC focusing with the estimation model/algorithm, benefits, drawbacks and estimation error are extensively reviewed. The review highlights many factors and challenges with possible recommendations for the development of BMS and estimation of SOC in next-generation EV applications. All the highlighted insights of this review will widen the increasing efforts towards the development of the advanced SOC estimation method and energy management system of lithium-ion battery for the future high-tech EV applications.},

abstract = {The use of batteries in combination with PV systems in single homes is expected to become a widely applied energy storage solution. Since PV system cost is decreasing and the electricity market is constantly evolving there is marked interest in understanding the performance and economic benefits of adding battery systems to PV generation under different retail tariffs. The performance of lead-acid (PbA) and lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery systems in combination with PV generation for a single home in Switzerland is studied using a time-dependant analysis. Firstly, the economic benefits of the two battery types are analysed for three different types of tariffs, i.e. a dynamic tariff based on the wholesale market (one price per hour for every day of the year), a flat rate and time-of-use tariff with two periods. Secondly, the reduction of battery capacity and annual discharge throughout the battery lifetime are simulated for PbA and Li-ion batteries. It was found that despite the levelised value of battery systems reaches up to 28{\%} higher values with the dynamic tariff compared to the flat rate tariff, the levelised cost increases by 94{\%} for the dynamic tariff, resulting in lower profitability. The main reason for this is the reduction of equivalent full cycles performed with by battery systems with the dynamic tariff. Economic benefits also depend on the regulatory context and Li-ion battery systems were able to achieve internal rate of return (IRR) up to 0.8{\%} and 4.3{\%} in the region of Jura (Switzerland) and Germany due to higher retail electricity prices (0.25. CHF/kW. h and 0.35. CHF/kW. h respectively) compared to Geneva (0.22. CHF/kW. h) where the maximum IRR was equal to -0.2{\%}.},

@article{Angenendt2019,
abstract = {Renewable energies from residential photovoltaic systems can be used in the electricity sector as well as in the residential heating sector. Therefore, sector coupling, for example by using heat pump systems, is mandatory. Integrated homes use photovoltaic energy for space heating and domestic hot water to contribute to the decarbonization of the heating sector. The economics are a key to increasing the market penetration of integrated homes. Combined operation strategies for the electricity sector as well as for the heating sector can enhance the economics of these systems. This paper analyses different operation strategies for both electrical and thermal systems and examines the gain in efficiency by combined strategies. Furthermore, the dimensioning of the different system components heavily influences the economics of the integrated home. Capital-intensive components, such as photovoltaic generators, battery storage systems, heat pumps, and thermal storage units, play a major role for the profitability. Therefore, the optimization of component sizing is necessary in order to enhance the economics of the system. This paper presents optimization results based on the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy. The results of the paper indicate that combined operation strategies as well as the optimization of the component sizes strongly influence the economics of photovoltaic battery energy storage systems with power-to-heat coupling. The impact of the optimization on the economic efficiency is higher compared to the influence of advanced combined operation strategies. The optimization indicates that relatively small storage units are more economical. The use of the heating sector as additional storage for excess photovoltaic energy is only economical to a minor degree, because it reduces the coefficient of performance of the heat pump.},

Based on a review of published literature technical aspects of heat pump flexibility, fields of application and control approaches are structured and discussed. Three main categories of applications using heat pumps in a smart grid context have been identified: First stable and economic operation of power grids, second the integration of renewable energy sources and third operation under variable electricity prices. In all fields heat pumps - when controlled in an appropriate manner - can help easing the transition to a decentralized energy system accompanied by a higher share of prosumers and renewable energy sources. Predictive controls are successfully used in the majority of studies, often assuming idealized conditions. Topics for future research have been identified including: a transfer of control approaches from simulation to the field, a detailed techno-economic analysis of heat pump systems under smart grid operation, and the design of heat pump systems in order to increase flexibility are among the future research topics suggested.},

abstract = {Although widely accepted as a measure of the comparative lifetime costs of electricity generation alternatives, levelised cost of energy (LCOE) lacks a theoretical foundation in the academic literature and encompasses a number of areas where caution is important. Therefore, this paper seeks to provide a theoretical foundation by comparing the metric with alternative cost of energy metrics and by undertaking a brief literature review to describe its strengths and weaknesses. In comparison with other potential measures of unit cost of energy, LCOE is found to be the preferred choice, in large part because of its widespread adoption. The weaknesses of the LCOE are found to centre on discount rate, inflation effects and the sensitivity of results to uncertainty in future commodity costs. These weaknesses are explored in the context of comparing combined cycle gas fired generation and offshore wind in the UK, based on publicly available cost measures. It is found that with variability of future fuel gas prices, and a Monte Carlo approach to modelling LCOE, the range of LCOE for CCGT is much broader in comparison to the LCOE of offshore wind. It is urged that explicit account be taken of the areas of weakness in future use of LCOE.},

abstract = {Electricity production is responsible for 32{\%} of total global fossil fuel use, accounting for 132 EJ, and 41{\%}, or 10.9 Gt of energy-related CO2emissions. Improving the efficiency of electricity production therefore offers economic benefits and a significant opportunity for reducing dependence on fossil fuels, which helps to combat climate change and improve energy security. A set of indicators has been developed to analyse the energy efficiency of electricity production from fossil fuels on a global level and for a number of key countries and regions. These indicators show the efficiency of electricity production from coal, natural gas and oil separately and from all fossil fuels together. The technical potentials for energy and CO2savings from improving the energy efficiency of electricity production are also calculated. The global average efficiencies of electricity production are 34{\%} for coal, 40{\%} for natural gas and 37{\%} for oil. For all fossil fuels, the global average efficiency is 36{\%}. Wide variations are seen in efficiencies amongst countries, with OECD countries typically having the highest efficiencies. The level of efficiency has been slowly improving in recent years in most countries. However, significant fuel and CO2saving potentials still exist. Across all fossil fuels the technical fuel savings potential is between 21 EJ and 29 EJ per year, with an associated CO2reduction potential of 1.8 Gt CO2to 2.5 Gt CO2per year. The largest savings are from improving the efficiency of coal-fired plants, which alone could provide savings of between 15 EJ and 21 EJ (1.4 Gt CO2to 2.0 Gt CO2). On a regional basis, just less than half the global savings would come from OECD countries, with the remainder from developing countries.},

Hydrogen, which is clean energy carrier, can be produced by using solar electric energy from photovoltaic (PV) modules for the water electrolysis without emitting carbon dioxide. Modeling of PV module-electrolyzer hydrogen system is important for their planning and control strategies in many applications. In this respect, high-efficiency co-generation systems for producing both heat and electricity coupled with clean energy sources such as PVs and fuel cells are gaining more attention, due to their advantages in terms of increasing efficiency and power quality, reducing harmful emissions and flexibility of operation. This study describes the analysis of the PV module-fuel cell hybrid system for house-hold micro co-generation applications. The system consists of PV modules, batteries, proton exchange membrane type water electrolyzer and proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). The excess heat of PEMFC was used to supply hot water and/or heating energy of the house. Electrical energy was stored in the batteries. The analysis of the PV-electrolyzer-PEMFC system can be further used for designing co-generation systems for various application optimizing the PV module, electrolyzer and PEMFC sizes.},

Exergy, energy and exergoeconomic analysis is conducted to determine the performance of the system under different operating and environmental conditions. The renewable energy system consisted of wind turbines and PV panels for electricity production operating an electrolyser which produced hydrogen. Hydrogen either goes directly to a fuel cell to produce electricity or through a compressor to run the fuel cell at high pressure. The heat from the fuel cell is used to heat water for domestic use. The analysis is conducted to determine the efficiencies of the system with and without domestic hot water heating and incorporating a compressor in the system. The analysis results suggested that approximately 14{\%} energy and 21{\%} exergy system efficiency increment is achieved when water is heated for domestic use. System involving the compressor lowered the overall system energy and exergy efficiencies. Decrease in efficiencies can be associated to the increase in hydrogen density, at high pressure states, which requires greater compressor work. The exergoeconomic study also suggested an improvement in the system when domestic water is heated using the excess heat from fuel cell. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In recent years, distributed energy systems (DESs) have been recognized as a promising option for sustainable development of future energy systems, and their application has increased rapidly with supportive policies and financial incentives. With growing concerns on global warming and depletion of fossil fuels, design optimization of DESs through economic assessments for short-run benefits only is not sufficient, while application of exergy principles can improve the efficiency in energy resource use for long-run sustainability of energy supply. The innovation of this paper is to investigate exergy in DES design to attain rational use of energy resources including renewables by considering energy qualities of supply and demand. By using low-temperature sources for low-quality thermal demand, the waste of high-quality energy can be reduced, and the overall exergy efficiency can be increased. The goal of the design optimization problem is to determine types, numbers and sizes of energy devices in DESs to reduce the total annual cost and increase the overall exergy efficiency. Based on a pre-established DES superstructure with multiple energy devices such as combined heat and power and PV, a multi-objective linear problem is formulated. In modeling of energy devices, the novelty is that the entire available size ranges and the variation of their efficiencies, capital and operation and maintenance costs with sizes are considered. The operation of energy devices is modeled based on previous work on DES operation optimization. By minimizing a weighted sum of the total annual cost and primary exergy input, the problem is solved by branch-and-cut. Numerical results show that the Pareto frontier provides good balancing solutions for planners based on economic and sustainability priorities. The total annual cost and primary exergy input of DESs with optimized configurations are reduced by 21–36{\%} as compared with conventional energy supply systems, where grid power is used for the electricity demand, and gas-fired boilers and electric chillers fed by grid power for thermal demand. A sensitivity analysis is also carried out to analyze the influence of energy prices and energy demand variation on the optimized DES configurations.},

The objective of this work is to evaluate the feasibility of a completely renewable supply of power and heat for an isolated household, and a comparison to reference and alternative energy supply scenarios. In this paper, an energy system using fossil and renewable energy sources is compared to a system using only renewable energy sources (solar and wind) with hydrogen-based energy storage technologies. A reference household in Slovenia's coastal region was used for modelling and numerical simulation. Simulations and optimal energy system identification were conducted by considering the geographical location and availability of energy sources, load dynamics, and components' technical and economical characteristics. A household with electricity consumption of 11kWh/day, hourly peak power demand of 3.8kW and 660L of oil-equivalent yearly heat demand was considered as the stand-alone load. The results show that 100{\%} renewable electricity and heat supply of a reference household is technically feasible and is more cost-effective, compared to systems utilising fossil heat.},

An economic model and optimization method are introduced here for the performance of hybrid combined heat and power systems that are grid-connected and use solar, wind and fuel cell technologies for residential uses. The optimization considers the costs of supplying energy, exchanging power with the local grid, solar power generation, wind power production, thermal energy recovery from the fuel cell, and maintenance. The optimization objective is to minimize the operation and maintenance cost of the hybrid combined heat and power systems subject to relevant constraints. The genetic algorithm and the particle swarm optimization algorithm, both of which are efficient metaheuristic optimization techniques, are used and compared. The results show that the most cost effective for satisfying the residential load in near future is the grid-connected hybrid combined heat and power system. Moreover, the genetic algorithm leads to better results than the particle swarm optimization algorithm.},

While guaranteeing reliable system operation, the model may determine the optimal running strategies with annual running cost or annual CO2 emissions as the objective function to be minimized. In addition, besides the energy flows among the equipments within the hybrid energy system, the economic information including electricity tariff and natural gas price, as well as some policy issues (e.g., buy-back price) are also accounted. As the results of the model, besides the optimal electric and thermal balances, the rational utilization forms of PV module, fuel cell and battery can be also deduced. To verify the viability of the proposed approach, a numerical example is implemented and analyzed. The optimal operating strategies are deduced and compared from different perspectives. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the PV module mainly contributes to the environmental performance of the assumed hybrid energy system, while the battery may be beneficial from the economic viewpoint.},

abstract = {Fuel cells offer one of the most eco-friendly and efficient ways of energy production. In this study a thermodynamic and exergoeconomic assessment of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system at steady-state operation condition are carried out. Thereafter, the feasibility of integrating a proton exchange membrane Electrolyzer (PEME) to supply required fuel for a PEMFC, operating in the same outlet power range is investigated. The results demonstrate that increasing the current density rises the following parameters in the system: the power and power density rates of the PEMFC and PEME, the exergy destruction rate of each component, the hydrogen production and consumption rates in the cycles, the PEME output voltage, cost rate of power generation and the power cost of the PEMFC. By increasing the PEMFC output voltage, the energy and exergy efficiencies reduce. Moreover, rising the outlet temperature of the PEMFC increases the power and power density rates of the PEMFC and also the energy and exergy efficiencies of the system. While increasing the outlet and operating temperature of the PEME increases the power consumption rate and reduces the energy and exergy efficiencies. The highest energy efficiency of the PEMFC is 36.7{\%} and corresponding maximum exergy efficiency is found 54{\%}, while the lowest values are found 31{\%} and 45.3{\%}, respectively. The cost rate of the power generation by PEMFC is varied between 7.96 × 10−4 and 1.33 × 10−3 {\$}/s and the corresponding rate of the exergy unit cost range is 115.6–132.2 {\$}/GJ.},

abstract = {In this paper, cost-efficient operation problem of photovoltaic/battery/fuel cell hybrid energy system has been evaluated in the presence of demand response program. Each load curve has off-peak, mid and peak time periods in which the energy prices are different. Demand response program transfers some amount of load from peak periods to other periods to flatten the load curve and minimize total cost. So, the main goal is to meet the energy demand and propose a cost-efficient approach to minimize system's total cost including system's electrical cost and thermal cost and the revenue from exporting power to the upstream grid. A battery has been utilized as an electrical energy storage system and a heat storage tank is used as a thermal energy storage system to save energy in off-peak and mid-peak hours and then supply load in peak hours which leads to reduction of cost. The proposed cost-efficient operation problem of photovoltaic/battery/fuel cell hybrid energy system is modeled by a mixed-integer linear program and solved by General algebraic modeling system optimization software under CPLEX solver. Two case studies are investigated to show the effects of demand response program on reduction of total cost.},

A detailed approach for the design of an optimized PV water pumping system based on real water usage data is proposed. Besides, system design work and performance assessment were carried out based on hourly climatic conditions. Overall, two approaches were investigated for an optimum design of the proposed system. Annual simulations indicated that the direct coupling, as a first option, appears to be unfitting configuration for water pumping in this case. In turn, results proved that second system including a MPPT DC converter with less PV arrays could pump more water and its performance remarkably surpassed the direct coupling configuration. In addition, economic analysis has shown that proposed systems are cost competitive against the conventional water supply methods.},

The aim of this design is minimization of annualized cost of the hybrid system over its 20 years of operation. Optimization problem is subject to reliable supply of the demand. Three major components of the system, i.e. wind turbine generators, photovoltaic arrays, and DC/AC converter, may be subject to failure. Also, solar radiation, wind speed, and load data are assumed entirely deterministic. System costs involve investments, replacement, and operation and maintenance as well as loss of load costs. Prices are all empirical and components are commercially available. An advanced variation of Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. Results reveal the impact of component outages on the reliability and cost of the system, so they are directly dependent on components' reliabilities, i.e. outages result in need for a larger generating system for supplying the load with the acceptable reliability. Additionally, it is observed that the inverter's reliability is an upper limit for the system's reliability. Moreover, an approximate method for reliability evaluation of the hybrid system is proposed which considerably reduces the time and computations. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In future electricity systems with a high share of intermittent renewable power generation, battery technologies have the potential to support power quality and security. The growing scientific literature on batteries reflects the high attention that currently rests on these technologies. This paper reviews the existing literature on lifecycle costs of batteries in stationary applications. The primary result of this review is that, despite the current high degree of variance in technological and economic battery data, a systematic assessment of the underlying uncertainty is lacking. The present paper addresses this disparity with an investigation of the impact of uncertainty in input parameters on lifecycle costs of four battery technologies across six electricity system applications. Based on input data collected from literature and via expert interviews, a probabilistic techno-economic model was built that calculates lifecycle costs and systematically addresses uncertainty in input parameters by applying a Monte Carlo simulation. The main conclusion of this paper is that the present uncertainty in cost and technical parameters of batteries exceeds by far the differences in lifecycle costs across technologies. For most electricity storage applications, the absolute differences in mean lifecycle costs across technologies are negligible compared to the uncertainty ranges of the mean lifecycle costs. Therefore, a competition still exists between the four analyzed battery technologies and so far a leading technology has yet to emerge in any of the investigated applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

This system is compared with two reference cases: PV-diesel generator and PV-Batteries. These different systems have been represented using empirical and semi-empirical models and are simulated with the CEA made ODYSSEY platform.

The PV-Batteries-H2 system is operated by an efficient power management strategy and its optimal sizing is assessed on the basis of technical (e.g. load satisfaction) and economic (e.g. levelized cost of electricity) criteria.

@article{Lukac2016,
abstract = {Within the last few years, the increase of the world's energy consumption has substantially impacted the environment. Solar energy initiative is more than ever involved to tackle this issue, especially when deploying PV (photovoltaic) systems over large-scale residential areas. However, not all surfaces in these areas are economically suitable, while some surfaces have low CO 2 mitigation. With the availability of high-resolution remote sensing data, the estimation of suitable rooftops for PV systems installation can be performed automatically by estimating the PV potential. This paper presents a novel method for estimating NPV (net present value) of the potential PV systems installed on rooftops by using LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) data and PV systems' nonlinear efficiency characteristics. More importantly, the environmental impact is estimated for each rooftop through EPBT (energy payback time) and GGER (greenhouse gas emission rate), based on the life-cycle of a specific PV system. This is combined with NPV in order to find rooftops that are both economically and environmentally viable candidates for PV systems deployment. Results demonstrate a case study LiDAR data for predicting each building's economical and environmental impact, as well as providing an overall view of resulting cumulative CO 2 mitigation over large residential area.},

@article{Neto2008,
abstract = {There are several ways to attempt to model a building and its heat gains from external sources as well as internal ones in order to evaluate a proper operation, audit retrofit actions, and forecast energy consumption. Different techniques, varying from simple regression to models that are based on physical principles, can be used for simulation. A frequent hypothesis for all these models is that the input variables should be based on realistic data when they are available, otherwise the evaluation of energy consumption might be highly under or over estimated. In this paper, a comparison is made between a simple model based on artificial neural network (ANN) and a model that is based on physical principles (EnergyPlus) as an auditing and predicting tool in order to forecast building energy consumption. The Administration Building of the University of S{\~{a}}o Paulo is used as a case study. The building energy consumption profiles are collected as well as the campus meteorological data. Results show that both models are suitable for energy consumption forecast. Additionally, a parametric analysis is carried out for the considered building on EnergyPlus in order to evaluate the influence of several parameters such as the building profile occupation and weather data on such forecasting. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This paper proposes a two-stage stochastic programming model for the optimal design of distributed energy systems. A two-stage decomposition based solution strategy is used to solve the optimization problem with genetic algorithm performing the search on the first stage variables and a Monte Carlo method dealing with uncertainty in the second stage. The model is applied to the planning of a distributed energy system in a hotel. Detailed computational results are presented and compared with those generated by a deterministic model.

Optimization studies are then carried out using Homer Energy software to determine the optimal system configuration which has the lowest cost of energy. Historical data of hourly solar irradiation and wind speed were also used in the study to obtain a realistic result. A special case study for the rural scenario with a partial connectivity to the grid is also conducted which is reminiscent to the poor reliability of supply in India. The study also gives a detail comparison between the various cost components, electrical productions, energy management and emissions for each of these systems.

abstract = {This paper presents a sizing method and different control strategies for the suitable energy management of a stand-alone hybrid system based on photovoltaic (PV) solar panels, hydrogen subsystem and battery. The battery and hydrogen subsystem, which is composed of fuel cell (FC), electrolyzer and hydrogen storage tank, act as energy storage and support system. In order to efficiently utilize the energy sources integrated in the hybrid system, an appropriate sizing is necessary. In this paper, a new sizing method based on Simulink Design Optimization (SDO) of MATLAB was used to perform a technical optimization of the hybrid system components. An analysis cost has been also performed, in that the configuration under study has been compared with those integrating only batteries and only hydrogen system. The dynamic model of the designed hybrid system is detailed in this paper. The models, implemented in MATLAB-Simulink environment, have been designed from commercially available components. Three control strategies based on operating modes and combining technical-economic aspects are considered for the energy management of the hybrid system. They have been designed, primarily, to satisfy the load power demand and, secondarily, to maintain a certain level at the hydrogen tank (hydrogen energy reserve), and at the state of charge (SOC) of the battery bank to extend its life, taking into account also technical-economic analysis. Dynamic simulations were performed to evaluate the configuration, sizing and control strategies for the energy management of the hybrid system under study in this work. Simulation results show that the proposed hybrid system with the presented controls is able to provide the energy demanded by the loads, while maintaining a certain energy reserve in the storage sources. {\textcopyright} 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

@article{Engine2019,
abstract = {If more widely deployed, small-scale cogeneration could increase energy efficiency in Europe. Of the two main commercially available technologies—the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) and the micro Gas Turbine (mGT)—the ICE dominates the market due to its higher electrical efficiency. However, by transforming the mGT into a micro Humid Air Turbine (mHAT), the electrical efficiency of this cycle can increase, thus enhancing its operational flexibility. This paper presents an in-depth policy and economic assessment of the the ICE, mGT and mHAT technologies for dwellings based in Spain, France and Belgium. The hourly demands of average households, the market conditions and the subsidies applicable in each region are considered. The aim is twofold: to evaluate the profitability of the technologies and to assess the cogeneration policies in place. The results show that only the ICE in Brussels is economically viable, despite all units providing positive energy savings in all locations (except mHAT in Spain). Of the three different green certificate schemes offered in Belgium, Brussels is the one leading to the best outcome. Spain awards both capital and operational helps, although auto-consumption is not valued. The same applies to the complex French feed-in tariff. Conclusively, with the current policies, investing in small-scale cogeneration is in general not attractive and its potential efficiency gains remain unveiled.},

abstract = {Electricity demand in remote and island areas are generally supplied by diesel or other fossil fuel based generation systems. Nevertheless, due to the increasing cost and harmful emissions of fossil fuels there is a growing trend to use standalone hybrid renewable energy systems (HRESs). Due to the complementary characteristics, matured technologies and availability in most areas, hybrid systems with solar and wind energy have become the popular choice in such applications. However, the intermittency and high net present cost are the challenges associated with solar and wind energy systems. In this context, optimal sizing is a key factor to attain a reliable supply at a low cost through these standalone systems. Therefore, there has been a growing interest to develop algorithms for size optimization in standalone HRESs. The optimal sizing methodologies reported so far can be broadly categorized as classical algorithms, modern techniques and software tools. Modern techniques, based on single artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, are becoming more popular than classical algorithms owing to their capabilities in solving complex optimization problems. Moreover, in recent years, there has been a clear trend to use hybrid algorithms over single algorithms mainly due to their ability to provide more promising optimization results. This paper aims to present a comprehensive review on recent developments in size optimization methodologies, as well as a critical comparison of single algorithms, hybrid algorithms, and software tools used for sizing standalone solar and wind HRES. In addition, an evaluation of all the possible combinations of standalone solar and wind energy systems, including their assessment parameters of economical, reliability, environmental, and social aspects, are also presented.},

abstract = {Energy resources are an irreplaceable life resource in the current world, with the use and management of these an important indicator of development. In parallel to the developing world economy, the increase in the use of energy resources is increasingly consuming existing fossil sources and also increasing the amount of greenhouse gas released into the atmosphere. As a result of resulting material and environmental concerns, renewable energy resources have begun to be used as alternative energy resources. These resources have advantages such as sustainability and environmental friendliness, in addition to having disadvantages such as higher investment costs and also system reliability is insufficient to provide for continuous demand for energy. To resolve these disadvantages, hybrid systems have been developed involving the use of more than one type of renewable energy resource and/or use with traditional energy resources and/or integration with storage systems. The use of these systems requires finding the solution to optimization problems including one or more objectives such as sizing the system to minimize energy costs, system management to balance the uncertainty of energy produced or reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. This article was prepared with the aim of investigating optimization techniques developed from past to present to solve this problem and especially to determine the efficacy of multi-objective optimization approaches.},

@article{Gimelli2017,
abstract = {The widespread adoption of combined heat and power generation is widely recognized as a strategic goal to achieve significant primary energy savings and lower carbon dioxide emissions. In this context, the purpose of this research is to evaluate the potential of cogeneration based on reciprocating gas engines for some Italian hospital buildings. Comparative analyses have been conducted based on the load profiles of two specific hospital facilities and through the study of the cogeneration system-user interaction. To this end, a specific methodology has been set up by coupling a specifically developed calculation algorithm to a genetic optimization algorithm, and a multi-objective approach has been adopted. The results from the optimization problem highlight a clear trade-off between total primary energy savings (TPES) and simple payback period (SPB). Optimized plant configurations and management strategies show TPES exceeding 18{\%} for the reference hospital facilities and multi–gas engine solutions along with a minimum SPB of approximately three years, thereby justifying the European regulation promoting cogeneration. However, designing a CHP plant for a specific energetic, legislative or market scenario does not guarantee good performance when these scenarios change. For this reason, the proposed methodology has been enhanced in order to focus on some innovative aspects. In particular, this study proposes an uncommon and effective approach to identify the most stable plant solutions through a multi-objective robust design optimization. In particular, the sensitivity of the expected results to possible difficulties in finding commercially available CHP gas engines with sizes reasonably close to the optimal numerical solutions has been estimated. The results indicate that the economic sensitivity is often higher than the energetic sensitivity for most of the optimal solutions, with standard deviation accounting up to 7{\%} of its mean value for the SPB, whereas that percentage is always under 3{\%} for the TPES. Furthermore, the research highlights how the expected results obtained through a deterministic definition of the input decision variables could be overestimated compared to the robust design approach. The proposed research also highlights how optimized CHP plants can be characterized by reasonable levels of energetic and economic sensitivity to changes in the following variable quantities: selling price of electricity, reference efficiency of the Italian thermoelectric generation and selling price of the energy efficiency certificates recognized by the Italian legislation. Indeed, Pareto optimal solutions indicate that the standard deviation for the SPB is always less than 3.5{\%} of its mean value, while this percentage is always under 7{\%} for the TPES.},

For a successful transition to a renewable energy economy the traditional approach of designing energy systems to meet only goals related to the technology (capacity, availability, reliability) and economics (return on investment, cost to the consumer) must evolve to take on a more holistic viewpoint and be able to take into account other goals addressing environmental and social considerations. This paper reviews approaches for integrating hydrogen energy technology into hybrid energy systems, emphasising electricity generation using a hydrogen fuel cell. Integration of energy storage, sizing methodologies, energy flow management and their associated optimization algorithms and software implementation are addressed. Few published case studies go beyond technical considerations. This reality is discussed in the light of available software packages. A four-dimensional multi-objective meta-heuristic function is proposed with weighting of technical, economic, environmental and socio-political factors to suit the design goals for the energy system.},

abstract = {This work aims at analysing the performances of a prototype of a high pressure Polymer Electrolyte Membrane water electrolyser. The whole work was funded in the framework of the Italian FISR (Research special supplementary funding) project. The high pressure electrolyser prototype was manufactured by Giner Inc. (Massachusetts, USA), whereas the test bench was expressly designed and built thanks to the collaboration with LAQ INTESE (High Quality Laboratory - Technological Innovation for Energetic Sustainability) and with Sapio SpA (Monza, Milan, Italy). An electrochemical model of the electrolyser stack is developed, which calculates the theoretical open-circuit voltage via a thermodynamic analysis of the process, and then obtains the expected real voltage during operation by calculating the different overvoltages as function of the current. The final result of the model is a theoretical polarisation curve. Experimental results are then presented and compared with the model theoretical results, and thanks to an experimental data fitting it is possible to obtain the estimated values of some important process parameters and their trend in different temperature and pressure conditions. {\textcopyright} 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

abstract = {With distributed generation of electricity growing in importance (especially with photovoltaics) and buildings being one of the main consumers of energy in modern societies, distributed storage of energy in buildings is expected to become increasingly present. This paper analyses the use of residential lead–acid energy storage coupled with photovoltaics and its possible interaction with the grid for different limits of feed-in power without any support policies. In the literature, these subjects are often treated independently and for very specific, non-optimised cases, thus motivating further research. Results show that reaching self-sufficiency values up to 40{\%} is possible, close to grid parity values, and only with photovoltaics. Beyond 40{\%}, energy storage must be used, strongly raising the cost of the electricity consumed and therefore the need for support policies for widespread adoption. Also, peak power consumption from the grid remains constant and load variability rises, suggesting that an increase in self-sufficiency would be accompanied by lower utilisation factors of power plants and, consequently, higher wholesale electricity prices during no sunshine hours. Limiting feed-in power attenuates the increased load variability and only slightly affects the economic viability of such installations. These results present a novel optimisation tool for developers and should be considered in future studies of distributed photovoltaics and energy storage as well as in energy policy.},

abstract = {Hydrogen as an energy currency, carrier and storage medium may be a key component of the solution to problems of global warming, poor air quality and dwindling reserves of liquid hydrocarbon fuels. Hydrogen is a flexible storage medium and can be generated by the electrolysis of water. It is particularly advantageous if an electrolyser may be simply and efficiently coupled to a source of renewable electrical energy. This paper examines direct coupling of a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyser to a matched solar photovoltaic (PV) source for hydrogen generation and storage. Such direct coupling with minimum interfacing electronics would lead to substantial cost reduction and thereby enhance the economic viability of solar-hydrogen systems. The electrolyser is designed for fail-safe operation with multiple levels of safety and operational redundancy. A control system in the electrolyser unit provides for disconnection when required and for auto-start in the morning and auto shut-down at night, simultaneously addressing the goals of minimum energy loss and maximum safety. The PV system is a 2.4 kW array (20.4 m2 total area) comprising 30, 12 V, 80 W, Solarex polycrystalline modules in a series-parallel configuration. The integrated system has been operated for approximately 60 days over a 4-month period from September 2007 to January 2008 with many periods of unattended operation for multiple days, experiencing weather ranging from hot and sunny (above 40 ??C) to cool and cloudy. The principle and practicality of direct coupling of a suitably matched PV array and PEM electrolyser have been successfully demonstrated. Details of electrolyser operation coupled to a PV array along with modelling work to match current-voltage characteristics of the electrolyser and PV system are described. Crown Copyright ?? 2009.},

abstract = {Solar energy will make a valuable contribution for power generation in the future. However the intermittency of solar energy has become an important issue in the utilization of PV system, especially small scale distributed solar energy conversion systems. The issue can be addressed through the management of production and storage of the energy in the form of hydrogen. The hydrogen can be produced by solar photovoltaic (PV) powered electrolysis of water. The amount of transferred energy to an electrolyzer from a PV module is a function of the distance between maximum power points (MPP) of PV module and the electrolyzer operating points. The distance can be minimized by optimizing the number of series and parallel units of the electrolyzer. However the maximum power points are subject to PV module characteristics, solar irradiation and ambient temperature. This means the climate condition can substantially influence the MPP and therefore the optimal size of the PV-Electrolyzer (PV/EL) system. On the other hand, system size can affect the levelized cost of hydrogen production as well. In this paper, the impact of climate conditions on the optimal size and operating conditions of a direct coupled photovoltaic-electrolyzer system has been studied. For this purpose, the optimal size of electrolyzer for six cities which have different climate condition is obtained by considering two solution scenarios, regarding two objectives which are annual energy transfer loss and levelized costs of hydrogen production and then the optimal results for these cities are compared. The results show that the climate condition can strongly affect the size of the electrolyzer, the annual hydrogen production and consequently, both the levelized costs of hydrogen production and annual energy transfer loss. Moreover, it is found out that the solar to hydrogen efficiency of the optimal systems regarding these cities are different based on the solution scenarios, the characteristics of PV output power and the configuration of optimal electrolyzer configuration and placement.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 CIMNE, Barcelona, Spain Robust design optimization (RDO) has been eminent, ascertaining optimal configuration of engineering systems in presence of uncertainties. However, computational aspect of conventional RDO can often get computationally intensive as neighborhood assessments of every solution are required to compute the performance variance and ensure feasibility. Surrogate assisted optimization is one of the efficient approaches in order to mitigate this issue of computational expense. However, the performance of a surrogate model plays a key factor in determining the optima in multi-modal and highly non-linear landscapes, in presence of uncertainties. In other words, the approximation accuracy of the model is principal in yielding the actual optima and thus, avoiding any misguide to the decision maker on the basis of false or, local optimum points. Therefore, an extensive survey has been carried out by employing most of the well-known surrogate models in the framework of RDO. It is worth mentioning that the numerical study has revealed consistent performance of a model out of all the surrogates utilized. Finally, the best performing model has been utilized in solving a large-scale practical RDO problem. All the results have been compared with that of Monte Carlo simulation results.},

Uncertainties in renewable resources, demand load and power modelling make deterministic methods of multi-objective optimisation fall short in optimal design of standalone hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES). Firstly, deterministic methods of analysis, even in the absence of uncertainties in cost modelling, do not predict the levelised cost of energy accurately. Secondly, since these methods ignore the random variations in parameters, they cannot be used to quantify the second objective, reliability of the system in supplying power. It is shown that for a given site and uncertainties profile, there exist an optimum margin of safety, applicable to the peak load, which can be used to size the diesel generator towards designing a cost-effective and reliable system. However, this optimum value is problem dependent and cannot be obtained deterministically. For two design scenarios, namely, finding the most reliable system subject to a constraint on the cost and finding the most cost-effective system subject to constraints on reliability measures, two algorithms are proposed to find the optimum margin of safety. The robustness of the proposed design methodology is shown through carrying out two design case studies. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

In each case, a base-case system that used established designs and materials was compared to prospective systems that might be envisioned and developed in the future with the goal of achieving substantially lower overall system costs. With identical overall plant efficiencies of 9.8percent, the unconcentrated PEC and non-grid connected PV-E system base-case capital expenses for the rated capacity of 3.65 kilotons H2 per year were {\$}205 MM ({\$}293 per m2 of solar collection area (mS-2), {\$}14.7 WH2,P-1) and {\$}260 MM ({\$}371 mS-2, {\$}18.8 WH2,P-1), respectively. The untaxed, plant-gate levelized costs for the hydrogen product (LCH) were {\$}11.4 kg-1 and {\$}12.1 kg-1 for the base-case PEC and PV-E systems, respectively. The 10? concentrated PEC base-case system capital cost was {\$}160 MM ({\$}428 mS-2, {\$}11.5 WH2,P-1) and for an efficiency of 20percent the LCH was {\$}9.2 kg-1. Likewise, the grid supplemented base-case PV-E system capital cost was {\$}66 MM ({\$}441 mS-2, {\$}11.5 WH2,P-1), and with solar-to-hydrogen and grid electrolysis system efficiencies of 9.8percent and 61percent, respectively, the LCH was {\$}6.1 kg-1. As a benchmark, a proton-exchange membrane (PEM) based grid-connected electrolysis system was analyzed. Assuming a system efficiency of 61percent and a grid electricity cost of {\$}0.07 kWh-1, the LCH was {\$}5.5 kg-1. A sensitivity analysis indicated that, relative to the base-case, increases in the system efficiency could effect the greatest cost reductions for all systems, due to the areal dependencies of many of the components. The balance-of-systems (BoS) costs were the largest factor in differentiating the PEC and PV-E systems. No single or combination of technical advancements based on currently demonstrated technology can provide sufficient cost reductions to allow solar hydrogen to directly compete on a levelized cost basis with hydrogen produced from fossil energy. Specifically, a cost of CO2 greater than ?{\$}800 (ton CO2)-1 was estimated to be necessary for base-case PEC hydrogen to reach price parity with hydrogen derived from steam reforming of methane priced at {\$}12 GJ-1 ({\$}1.39 (kg H2)-1). A comparison with low CO2 and CO2-neutral energy sources indicated that base-case PEC hydrogen is not currently cost-competitive with electrolysis using electricity supplied by nuclear power or from fossil-fuels in conjunction with carbon capture and storage. Solar electricity production and storage using either batteries or PEC hydrogen technologies are currently an order of magnitude greater in cost than electricity prices with no clear advantage to either battery or hydrogen storage as of yet. Significant advances in PEC technology performance and system cost reductions are necessary to enable cost-effective PEC-derived solar hydrogen for use in scalable grid-storage applications as well as for use as a chemical feedstock precursor to CO2-neutral high energy-density transportation fuels. Hence such applications are an opportunity for foundational research to contribute to the development of disruptive approaches to solar fuels generation systems that can offer higher performance at much lower cost than is provided by current embodiments of solar fuels generators. Efforts to directly reduce CO2 photoelectrochemically or electrochemically could potentially produce products with higher value than hydrogen, but many, as yet unmet, challenges include catalytic efficiency and selectivity, and CO2 mass transport rates and feedstock cost. Major breakthroughs are required to obtain viable economic costs for solar hydrogen production, but the barriers to achieve cost-competitiveness with existing large-scale thermochemical processes for CO2 reduction are even greater.},

abstract = {Photoelectrochemical water splitting is a promising route for the renewable production of hydrogen fuel. This work presents the results of a technical and economic feasibility analysis conducted for four hypothetical, centralized, large-scale hydrogen production plants based on this technology. The four reactor types considered were a single bed particle suspension system, a dual bed particle suspension system, a fixed panel array, and a tracking concentrator array. The current performance of semiconductor absorbers and electrocatalysts were considered to compute reasonable solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies for each of the four systems. The U.S. Department of Energy H2A model was employed to calculate the levelized cost of hydrogen output at the plant gate at 300 psi for a 10 tonne per day production scale. All capital expenditures and operating costs for the reactors and auxiliaries (compressors, control systems, etc.) were considered. The final cost varied from {\$}1.60-{\$}10.40 per kg H2 with the particle bed systems having lower costs than the panel-based systems. However, safety concerns due to the cogeneration of O2 and H2 in a single bed system and long molecular transport lengths in the dual bed system lead to greater uncertainty in their operation. A sensitivity analysis revealed that improvement in the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of the panel-based systems could substantially drive down their costs. A key finding is that the production costs are consistent with the Department of Energy's targeted threshold cost of {\$}2.00-{\$}4.00 per kg H2 for dispensed hydrogen, demonstrating that photoelectrochemical water splitting could be a viable route for hydrogen production in the future if material performance targets can be met.},

In this study, a wind and photovoltaic (PV) hybrid electrolyzer system, which maximizes the hydrogen production for a diurnal operation of the system, is designed and simulated. The operation of the system is optimized using imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA). The objective of this optimization is to combine the PV array and wind turbine (WT) in a way that, for minimized average excess power generation, maximum hydrogen would be produced. Actual meteorological data of Miami is used for simulations. A framework of the advanced alkaline electrolyzer with the detailed electro-chemical model is used. This optimal system comprises a PV module with a power of 7.9 kW and a WT module with a power of 11 kW. The rate of hydrogen production is 0.0192 mol/s; an average Faraday efficiency of 86.9 per-cent. The electrolyzer works with 53.7 percent of its nominal power. The availability of the wind for longer periods of time reflects the greater contribution of WT in comparison with PV towards the overall throughput of the system.},

abstract = {The global energy system has to be transformed towards high levels of sustainability for executing the COP21 agreement. Solar PV offers excellent characteristics to play a major role for this energy transition. Key objective of this work is to investigate the role of PV for the global energy transition based on respective scenarios and a newly introduced energy transition model developed by the authors at the Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT). The available energy transition scenarios have no consensus view on the future role of PV, but a progressive group of scenarios present results of a fast growth of installed PV capacities and a high energy supply share of solar energy to the total primary energy demand in the world in the decades to come. These progressive energy transition scenarios can be confirmed by the LUT Energy system model. The model derives total installed solar PV capacity requirements of 7.1 – 9.1 TWp for today's electricity sector and 27.4 TWp for the entire energy system in the mid-term (year 2030 assumptions set as reference). The long-term capacity is expected to be 42 TWp and due to the ongoing cost reduction of PV and battery technologies, this value is found to be the lower limit for the installed capacities. The cost reductions are taken into account for the year 2030, but are expected to further proceed beyond this reference year. Solar PV electricity is expected to be the largest, least cost and most relevant source of energy in the mid- to long-term for the global energy supply. Keywords},

abstract = {The automatic inverse design of three-dimensional plasmonic nanoparticles enables scientists and engineers to explore a wide design space and to maximize a device's performance. However, due to the large uncertainty in the nanofabrication process, we may not be able to obtain a deterministic value of the objective, and the objective may vary dramatically with respect to a small variation in uncertain parameters. Therefore, we take into account the uncertainty in simulations and adopt a classical robust design model for a robust design. In addition, we propose an efficient numerical procedure for the robust design to reduce the computational cost of the process caused by the consideration of the uncertainty. Specifically, we use a global sensitivity analysis method to identify the important random variables and consider the non-important ones as deterministic, and consequently reduce the dimension of the stochastic space. In addition, we apply the generalized polynomial chaos expansion method for constructing computationally cheaper surrogate models to approximate and replace the full simulations. This efficient robust design procedure is performed by varying the particles' material among the most commonly used plasmonic materials such as gold, silver, and aluminum, to obtain different robust optimal shapes for the best enhancement of electric fields.},

However, lack of a proper planning because of simplifications in the assumptions may overshadow the potentials of the DESs hitherto. Disregarding some intrinsic characteristics of a real world like uncertainties and noises may distort results and consequently undermine its efficiency. This paper mainly focused on designing a building's energy system under demand, costs (like carbon emission cost, primary energy saving...) and prices (like fuel tariff and electricity prices...) uncertainties concerning data insufficiency by means of robust optimization. Various sustainable technologies such as photovoltaic arrays were also considered as an alternative. In order to study the probable consequences, the proposed robust model was applied to a real-world problem and the outcomes were presented, analyzed and compared to the deterministic model's results.},

However, input parameters are in general uncertain. If uncertainties are disregarded in the optimization, solutions usually become infeasible in practice. To incorporate uncertain parameters, we apply the concept of minmax robust multi-objective optimization for designing sustainable energy supply systems. We propose a mixed-integer linear problem formulation. The proposed formulation allows to identify robust sustainable designs easily guaranteeing security of energy supply. Energy systems are shown to typically exhibit objective-wise uncertainties. Thus, a Pareto front can still be derived. In a real-world case study, robust designs are identified with a good trade-off between economic and ecologic criteria. The robust designs perform remarkably well in the nominal scenario. The presented problem formulation transfers the important theoretical concept of minmax robust multi-objective optimization into engineering practice for the design of sustainable energy systems.},

Uncertainties in wind power generation and energy consumption are described in the form of Prediction Intervals (PIs), estimated by a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) - trained Neural Network (NN). The framework is tested and exemplified in a microgrid formed by a middle-size train station (TS) with integrated photovoltaic power production system (PV), an urban wind power plant (WPP) and a surrounding residential district (D). The system is described by Agent-Based Modelling (ABM): each stakeholder is modeled as an individual agent, which aims at a specific goal, either of decreasing its expenses from power purchasing or increasing its revenues from power selling. The aim of this paper is to identify which is the uncertainty level associated to the "extreme" conditions upon which robust management decisions perform better than a microgrid management based on expected values.

abstract = {Energy models are valuable tools that are commonly employed for the optimal design of distributed energy systems (DES). However, the model-based design process of DES can be affected by uncertainty, which can lead to suboptimal design decisions and is introduced by aspects like the stochastic nature of renewables or the unknown future global energy and economy outlook. A critical first step of any effort to examine and incorporate uncertainty in the design process of DES includes the performance of a thorough uncertainty characterisation (UC). The UC task comprises the identification of the sources of uncertainty in the model's parameters and the assignment of a mathematical description to their uncertainty. The aim of this paper is to identify and categorise the most important uncertain parameters in typical DES design models and review the approaches used in the literature to represent their uncertainty. The uncertain aspects investigated pertain to the availability of renewable energy (wind and solar), the economic and environmental dimensions of energy carriers in a DES, the costs and technical characteristics of the technologies composing a DES, and, finally, the uncertain energy demands that a DES must satisfy. The analysis reveals the diversity and the varying complexity levels of the approaches used to characterise each parameter's uncertainty, as well as the specific parameters on which studies in the literature have mostly focused. Additionally, this review can serve to assist modellers who wish to introduce uncertainty considerations in their DES design model with the selection of appropriate UC approaches. Finally, in discussing the results of this review, directions for more effective UC in DES design are discussed, as well as suggestions for the integration of uncertainty in the design process of DES.},

The method uses only information available from the PV module and pump-motor manufacturers. Weather data are 'generated' from monthly averages of horizontal radiation and ambient temperatures using well-known weather data statistics. The method predicts monthly pumped water to within 6{\%} of TRNSYS predictions based on hourly weather data. The use of a single monthly-average day is shown to underpredict monthly pumped water at low monthly average radiation levels and overpredict monthly pumped water at intermediate radiation levels. Only at high radiation levels does the use of a single monthly-average day provide a reasonable estimation of monthly pumped water.},

abstract = {We propose in this work a simple model for atmospheric or low-pressure PEM water electrolysers, which allows for simulating the electrochemical, thermal and H2output flow behaviours with enough precision for engineering applications. The model has been validated by good agreement with experimental measurements performed in two different electrolysers. The electrochemical submodel allows for obtaining the operating stack voltage from the input current and the stack temperature conditions. After non-linear fitting and statistical analysis from experimental data we conclude that the electrochemical submodel can be extrapolated for any PEM water electrolyser knowing two parameters with physical meaning: activation energy of the "water oxidation" for the anode electrocatalyst and the activation energy for proton transport in the solid polymer membrane. This submodel was validated with experimental polarisation curves at different temperatures from two different PEM water electrolysers. The standard error of the model was less than 0.03. The results showed that the worst values of the estimation were obtained below 50 °C, indicating that the assumption of constant anode charge transfer coefficient is not true at lower temperature, which is in accordance with recent results. In order to complete the electrochemical submodel, a practical methodology is presented here to obtain simple semi-empirical submodels for the H2production and thermal behaviours for this kind of electrolysers. Both submodels are also discussed based on the experimental validations. {\textcopyright} 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Due to the variations of maximum power points of the PV module during a year and the complexity of the system, a nonlinear approach is considered. A mathematical model has been developed to determine the performance of the PV/EL system. The optimisation methodology presented here is based on the particle swarm optimisation algorithm. By this method, for the given number of PV modules, the optimal sizeand operating condition of a PV/EL system areachieved. The approach can be applied for different sizes of PV systems, various ambient temperatures and different locations with various climaticconditions. The results show that for the given location and the PV system, the energy transfer efficiency of PV/EL system can reach up to 97.83{\%}.},

The accurate electrical models of advanced alkaline electrolyser, photovoltaic system, and hydrogen storage tank are simulated using Matlab. The system is investigated for a day using actual meteorological data of Miami, FL. The purpose of the optimization, which has been performed using genetic algorithm, is to produce maximum hydrogen, minimum excess power, and minimum energy transfer loss. In each iteration of the optimization, due to crucial role of temperature in overall performance of the system, the average operating temperature is optimized using genetic algorithm. The system is optimized in a way that the operating condition is as close as possible to the maximum power point of the photovoltaic array. The operation of the system is discussed in 24 h period and working hours to make the system comparable to other studies with different power sources. The result of the analysis shows that optimal system for a 10 kW electrolyser can produce the average hydrogen of 0.0151 mol/s when the system is operating with 2.2{\%} power loss and 4.7{\%} power transfer loss.},

abstract = {The coupling of a photovoltaic generator and an electrolyser is one of the most promising options for obtaining hydrogen from a renewable energy source. Both are well known technologies, however, since the high variability of the solar radiation, an efficient coupling still presents some challenges. Direct or through a DC-DC converter couplings are the options in isolated applications. In this work, three models, respectively, for a photovoltaic (PV) generator, a controlled DC-DC converter and a complete proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyser have been designed by using Matlab/Simulink. A PV-electrolyser specific algorithm to search for the optimum and safe working point for both elements is presented. Simulation results demonstrate that the use of a controlled DC-DC converter with the proposed algorithm shows better adaptability to the variable radiation conditions than the other coupling options. Therefore, it leads to a better compliance between the electrolyser and the sizing of the PV generator. {\textcopyright} 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

abstract = {As the solar photovoltaic (PV) matures, the economic feasibility of PV projects is increasingly being evaluated using the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) generation in order to be compared to other electricity generation technologies. Unfortunately, there is lack of clarity of reporting assumptions, justifications and degree of completeness in LCOE calculations, which produces widely varying and contradictory results. This paper reviews the methodology of properly calculating the LCOE for solar PV, correcting the misconceptions made in the assumptions found throughout the literature. Then a template is provided for better reporting of LCOE results for PV needed to influence policy mandates or make invest decisions. A numerical example is provided with variable ranges to test sensitivity, allowing for conclusions to be drawn on the most important variables. Grid parity is considered when the LCOE of solar PV is comparable with grid electrical prices of conventional technologies and is the industry target for cost-effectiveness. Given the state of the art in the technology and favourable financing terms it is clear that PV has already obtained grid parity in specific locations and as installed costs continue to decline, grid electricity prices continue to escalate, and industry experience increases, PV will become an increasingly economically advantageous source of electricity over expanding geographical regions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The model is applied to Europe (EU-27 + Norway and Switzerland), which the model divides into ten electricity balance regions and runs with 2920 time-steps The model is applied in a greenfield setting, in which the share of renewables (VRE + Hydro) varies between 0{\%} and 100{\%}. The results show that the system LCOE for VRE increases linearly with the penetration level range of 20{\%}–80{\%}, above which it increases sharply. Systems that have a high penetration of VRE are characterized by using wind power as the major generating technology and having strong expansion of transmission capacity. A sensitivity analysis for the cost of VRE and variation management capacity (storage and transmission) reveals that the point of increase in marginal LCOE is robust under different future scenarios regarding technology costs. We conclude that VRE could constitute the bulk of electricity generation at a reasonable cost, given that there is availability of variation management, especially with respect to transmission.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. This work presents a hardware/software data acquisition system developed for monitoring the temperature in real time of the cells in Air-Cooled Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells (AC-PEFC). These fuel cells are of great interest because they can carry out, in a single operation, the processes of oxidation and refrigeration. This allows reduction of weight, volume, cost and complexity of the control system in the AC-PEFC. In this type of PEFC (and in general in any PEFC), the reliable monitoring of temperature along the entire surface of the stack is fundamental, since a suitable temperature and a regular distribution thereof, are key for a better performance of the stack and a longer lifetime under the best operating conditions. The developed data acquisition (DAQ) system can perform non-intrusive temperature measurements of each individual cell of an AC-PEFC stack of any power (from watts to kilowatts). The stack power is related to the temperature gradient; i.e., a higher power corresponds to a higher stack surface, and consequently higher temperature difference between the coldest and the hottest point. The developed DAQ system has been implemented with the low-cost open-source platform Arduino, and it is completed with a modular virtual instrument that has been developed using NI LabVIEW. Temperature vs time evolution of all the cells of an AC-PEFC both together and individually can be registered and supervised. The paper explains comprehensively the developed DAQ system together with experimental results that demonstrate the suitability of the system.},

abstract = {In the context of sustainable clean hydrogen production pathways, photovoltaic-electrolyzer systems are one of the most promising alternatives for acquiring hydrogen from renewable energy sources. In fact, determining the optimal set of design and operating variables are always a key issue while coupling directly renewable electricity sources to PEM electrolyzers. Few previous studies have attempted to find the optimal size and operational condition of directly coupled photovoltaic-electrolyzer (PV/El) systems in order to maximize the hydrogen production or to minimize energy transfer loss between photovoltaic devices and the electrolyzer. Nevertheless an easy and efficient approach still remains to be found. Because of the nonlinear nature of the system, in this framework, multi-objective nonlinear optimization is employed, an approach based on the method of imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA). It considers the effect of ambient temperature and radiation weather data during a whole year. Multi-objective optimization provides a wide range of optimal design and operating conditions, from which these variables can be selected based on objectives with different weight values. This allows performing the system optimization by considering two different objectives, namely, minimization of energy transfer loss and maximization of hydrogen production. The optimum system that focuses solely on maximum hydrogen production can produce 2.2{\%} more hydrogen than with its objective being minimum energy transfer loss. However, it results in 68{\%} more energy transfer loss in the process. The values can be adjusted with options that include a combination of the two objectives. Additionally, optimal variables can be found through the ICA method.},
